If you want to start your Web Developer Journey from scratch I recommend you to do the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Course. This course is beginner friendly. Bonus You will get a completion certificate from FreeCodeCamp. 
In that course focus more on HTML, CSS(position, display);
After that learn JS(Javascript).
Then learn Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS. I will recommend Bootstrap.
After that learn Nodejs.
After that choose ReactJS or AngularJS.
Kept doing projects regularly.

Thank you..!
